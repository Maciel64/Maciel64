## Hello! My name is ***Maciel Júnior*** 🎷


### Who I am and my personal objectives 😁
  - In 2019, I had my initial introduction to the realm of IT, and from that point forward, I discovered a profound passion for it. I embarked on a technical course in informatics at IFPB Campus Sousa - PB, Brazil, and presently, I am immersed in the pursuit of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at UnP - Natal - RN, Brazil. Over the span of these four years, I have acquired proficiency in a multitude of programming languages and tools.

- During this time, I also took up freelance work, engaging in the development of projects primarily centered around PHP. At present, my focus has shifted towards creating comprehensive systems utilizing the Node.js and React.js stack. My present aspiration revolves around becoming an integral member of a collaborative team. I am driven to make substantial contributions to the collective endeavor and, when feasible, to assume a leadership role within these teams in the future.

### More about me 😎
- At present, I am in the midst of my 20th year. Beyond my academic pursuits, I also have a rich tapestry of experiences. Notably, I contributed to my city's philharmonic band as a saxophonist, harmonizing my passion for music with my local community.

- Additionally, my involvement in the Demolay order stands out, where I assumed a leadership role, guiding a dynamic cohort of young individuals. Together, we orchestrated a series of volunteer initiatives aimed at uplifting the community. This engagement fostered my commitment to meaningful contributions and collaborative undertakings.

- Away from my responsibilities, I find solace in immersing myself in podcasts that delve into both contemporary and timeless cinematic creations. This auditory exploration reflects my profound appreciation for the world of film.

- Furthermore, my interests have taken a diverse turn, encompassing both nutrition and martial arts. The study of nutrition has captivated my attention, leading me to explore the intricacies of a balanced and healthful lifestyle. Concurrently, the realm of martial arts has piqued my curiosity, propelling me towards a journey of physical and mental growth.

- In essence, my life is an amalgamation of pursuits that enrich my journey, from music and leadership to cinematic appreciation, nutrition, and martial arts exploration.
